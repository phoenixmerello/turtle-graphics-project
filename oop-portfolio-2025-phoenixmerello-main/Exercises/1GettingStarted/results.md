Hello World

```
a. Change Test to test.\ Class 'test' is public, should be declared in a file named 'Test.java'

b. Change Emergency to emergency.\ No error produced, this is because Emergency can be written
in lower or upper case since it is not syntax code, it simply a string

c. Remove the first quotation mark in the string.\ cannot resolve symbol 'Broadcast'

d. Change main to man.\ Method 'man(java.lang.String[])' is never used

e. Change println to bogus.\ Cannot resolve method 'bogus' in 'PrintStream'

f. Remove the semicolon at the end of the println statement.\ ';' expected

g. Remove the last brace in the program.\ '}' expected
