# 🐢 Turtle Graphics Project

### 📚 Overview
This project was developed as part of my Object-Oriented Programming module at Leeds Beckett University (OOP 2025).  
It demonstrates the use of **object-oriented design**, **Java classes**, and **the turtle graphics library** to produce visual drawings using programmatic commands.

### 🧠 What the project does
- Implements a `Turtle` class that can move, draw lines, and respond to user commands.
- Applies key OOP principles: **Encapsulation**, **Inheritance**, and **Polymorphism**.
- Includes modular Java code for clean structure and reusability.
- Uses **LBUGraphics.jar** for graphics rendering.

### 🛠️ Technologies Used
- **Language:** Java  
- **Concepts:** Object-Oriented Programming (OOP), Classes & Objects, Loops, Methods  
- **Libraries:** LBUGraphics (Java graphics library)  
- **IDE:** IntelliJ / Eclipse (depending on setup)

### 🎯 Learning Outcomes
- Reinforced understanding of OOP design patterns.
- Practiced working with graphical libraries and event-driven programming.
- Improved debugging and project documentation skills.

### 🚀 How to Run
1. Clone or download this repository.
2. Open the project in your preferred Java IDE.
3. Ensure the `LBUGraphics.jar` file is added to your project libraries.
4. Run `TurtleGraphics.java` (or the main file) to start the program.
