## Notes
After completing all 9 weeks its really interesting how my programs have developed in how i write them, 
how i think when making them from the start of week one till week 9.
I now have a much better understanding of java as a whole and the weeks addressing different aspects of
java provide a well structured way of learning without feeling overwelmed. 
Some program requirements seem to be delibretely vauge to make you really think about how to write it 
i also believe that it allows a bit of creative expression since you can think of your own way of writing 
a program in java, meeting all the requirements and using good practises of course.

My Tips would be to take it on week by week without overthinking what you know and what you dont, complete
the different tasks set out and as long as ou understand what you are writing in code you will be fine. 
You should still do research online to understand what different things mean or do in java as it will help 
you in the future.
Once you start gaining momentum through the weeks you will start to see the bigger picture so to speak applying 
what you learned in previous weeks aswell as learning new things for the task you are doing, all this forces you
to peace things together and once you understand that you will find writing java programs much easier.
The fundamentals matter a lot as it is what we all build our programs upon and by the end of those 9 weeks you 
should have a good understanding of java and the different components that you have been taught

Further more i would encourage you to practise java programing in your own time aswell, sure you have to do
the programs of each week with set requirements and expected outputs but by creating programs on your own time 
you can practise your skills, learn new ones, learn more about java, make programs you are interested in, set
your own requirements and just experiment with it all. This i believe will not only help you with your weekly 
exercises but also for the long term even after you have completed your studies at university. 

In conclusion do not overthing or stress too much about what you know and dont know at the start it will all come 
in time focus on learning and completing the tasks, trust that each week will make you better, do your own research 
to improve your skills, make your own programs at home that you yourself find interesting to write and test and finally
dont work too hard do what you can and manage your time properly for everything.
